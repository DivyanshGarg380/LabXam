# Lab Exam Questions Hub

A clean and intuitive web application to help students access previous year lab exam questions, organized semester-wise, subject-wise, and evaluation-wise.

The goal of this project is to eliminate the need to search through scattered WhatsApp messages, PDFs, and shared drives before lab exams.

## Routing Logic

The application uses clean, query-based URLs.

Example: ``` questions?sem=<sem_name>&subject=<subject_name>&year=<year>&eval=<eval_type> ```

### URL Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|---------|------------|
| `sem` | Semester ID |
| `subject` | Subject ID |
| `year` | Year |
| `eval` | Evaluation type |

URL parameters are mapped internally to user-friendly labels before rendering.

---

## Data Handling

All questions are stored in a centralized TypeScript file using the following hierarchy:

``` Semester → Subject → Year → Evaluation → Questions ```

This approach:
- Keeps the application lightweight
- Avoids premature backend complexity
- Allows easy migration to an API or database later
